# Zkitter Groups

Top [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) organizations as per their number of followers are whitelisted and result in 2 groups:

- the [GitHub](https://github.com/) users who contributed at least to 1 of the public repositories of 1 of the whitelisted organizations.
- the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) addresses who casted at least 1 vote for 1 of the governance proposals of 1 of the whitelisted DAOs.

After turning these groups into [Semaphore](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/) groups, their members can anonymously use Zkitter.

**API:** see [openapi.json](public/openapi.json) for the full specification.
